# Multi-Modal Offer Search Agent System

Multimodal AI agent system that helps users discover real-time offers on Flights, Hotels, and Tours based on their credit/debit card details. Built using Google‚Äôs Agent Development Kit (ADK) and powered by OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o-mini as the primary LLM model, the agent automates the end-to-end process of collecting user preferences, searching for matching offers, and presenting curated results in a clear and personalized format.

This project showcases how multiple specialized agents can collaborate to perform a multi-turn, tool-augmented conversation‚Äîdemonstrating practical use of LLMs in deal aggregation and search automation.

## üîÅ Agent System Overview

This system is composed of the following interconnected agents:

### 1. `offer_choice_agent`
- Asks the user which type of offer they are looking for:  
  _Flight_, _Hotel_, or _Tour_.
- Stores the selected choice in a JSON object.

### 2. `collect_user_card_details_agent`
- Collects specific card-related details from the user:
  - Card Type (Credit/Debit)
  - Bank Name (e.g., HDFC, SBI)
  - Card Network (e.g., VISA, RuPay, Mastercard, Amex)
- Uses the selected `offer_choice` to contextualize the data.

### 3. `agent_search`
- Builds a search query using both the `offer_choice` and `user_card_details`.
- Searches online for current offers and stores results in `offer_search_results`.

### 4. `search_response_formatter_agent`
- Filters out expired or unrelated offers.
- Labels results clearly with:
  - Offer Type, Discount Details, Promo Code, Validity, Source Name
- Ensures only active offers (based on current datetime) are shown.

### 5. `coordinator_agent` *(Root Agent)*
- Orchestrates the flow between all agents in the correct order:
  1. Collect card details
  2. Ask for offer choice
  3. Search for relevant offers
  4. Format and return the final output to the user
